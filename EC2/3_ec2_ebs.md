# What is Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

* Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device.

* Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component

## Volume Types

* General Purpose SSD (GP2)
  * Balances both price and performance
  * Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334 GiB and above

* Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
  * Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
  * Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
  * Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume

* Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
  * Big Data
  * Data warehousing
  * Log processing
  * Cannot be a boot volume

* Cold HDD (SC1)
  * Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
  * File server
  * Cannot be a boot volume

* Magnetic (Standard)
  * Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types that is bootable
  * Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently and applications where the lowest storage cost is important
